## The Assignment

This assignment consisted of two parts:

1. An **R Shiny** application, complete with input, reactive output, and associated documentation

2. A **Reproducible Pitch Presentation** in R Studio Presenter, complete with embedded R code

## The Use Case

This application was designed to provide insight into the flow of observations through a complex, multi-step workflow. The inital tab provides a Sankey Diagram to help **visualize flow through the system**. The diagram is reactive, and as cases are filtered on their underlying characteristics (e.g. priority level, expected value) the Sankey will update as well. The second tab includes a reactive bar chart that provides **insight into case outcomes** (e.g. cost and revenue). 

This application is a proof of concept and all underyling data was simulated.

## The Sankey

```{r Sankey, echo = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=12, fig.align="center", message=FALSE}
nodes <- read.csv("data/nodes.csv")
raw_df <- read.csv("data/raw.csv", colClasses = c("numeric","character","character",
                                         "numeric","numeric","numeric","character"))

df <- raw_df


df$p1 <- substr(df$dna, start = 1, stop = 2)
df$p2 <- substr(df$dna, start = 2, stop = 3)
df$p3 <- substr(df$dna, start = 3, stop = 4)
df$finalnode <- substr(df$dna, start = nchar(df$dna), stop = nchar(df$dna))

## filter the df on stuff
df <- filter(df, filt2 > 0)

pair <- c(df$p1, df$p2, df$p3)
pair <- pair[!pair %in% c("0", "1", "2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9")]
tally <- data.frame(pair)

links <- tally %>% group_by(pair) %>% summarize(value = n())
links$source <- substr(links$pair, start = 1, stop = 1)
links$target <- substr(links$pair, start = 2, stop = 2)
links <- links %>% select(source, target, value)
links$source <- as.numeric(links$source)
links$target <- as.numeric(links$target)

# Plot
sankeyNetwork(Links = links, Nodes = nodes, Source = "source",
              Target = "target", Value = "value", NodeID = "name",
              units = "cases", fontSize = 12, nodeWidth = 30)
```

The **Sankey Diagram** allows users to visualize the flow of cases between steps in the workflow based on the reactive filters applied. In the example above we can see how cases start from a common point but eventually diverge towards *Mid2* and *Mid3*.

## The Bar Chart

```{r Bar, echo = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=12, fig.align="center"}

ggplot(data = df, aes(factor(finalnode), cost, fill = outcome)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + coord_flip() + theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

The **Bar Chart** allows users to understand the costs and revenues associated with the cases selected by the reactive filters. In the example above we can see the cases that end at *Node 2* (Mid2) resulted in the greatest cost to work. This is likely driven by their volume, which can be observed on the previous Sankey Diagram.
